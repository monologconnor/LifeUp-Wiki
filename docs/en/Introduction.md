## Motivation

![ÊøÄÂä±‰ΩìÁ≥ª](./introduction/_media/readme/motivation.jpg ':size=100%')

The design of `System of Motivation` was based on the `Sense of Ceremony`. The main features of LifeUp are associated to each other with strong relationships.

The `Level System`only inspirits you most when you take concern to the `Exp. Pt` and `Upgrading`.

The `Goods Store` makes the best effect on you, once you
would follow the `Reward System` designed by yourself.

**Certainly, some modules might do not meeting your demand, you could freely deprecate that module without breaking any user experience**, also you could start with some certain modules you focused on, and explore other modules step by step to make the most usage of LifeUp.
